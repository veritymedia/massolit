# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The detention email system currently uses a hardcoded cron schedule ("0 12 * * 1-5") that sends detention reports at 12:00 PM Monday through Friday. This feature will make the detention email timer configurable through an environment variable, allowing administrators to customize when detention reports are sent without requiring code changes or redeployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the detention email schedule using an environment variable, so that I can customize when detention reports are sent without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read a DETENTION_EMAIL_SCHEDULE environment variable for the cron schedule
2. IF the DETENTION_EMAIL_SCHEDULE environment variable is not set THEN the system SHALL use the current default schedule "0 12 * * 1-5"
3. WHEN a valid cron expression is provided in DETENTION_EMAIL_SCHEDULE THEN the system SHALL use that schedule for sending detention reports
4. IF an invalid cron expression is provided in DETENTION_EMAIL_SCHEDULE THEN the system SHALL log an error and fall back to the default schedule

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to validate the cron expression format, so that I can be notified of configuration errors during startup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system reads the DETENTION_EMAIL_SCHEDULE environment variable THEN it SHALL validate the cron expression format
2. IF the cron expression is invalid THEN the system SHALL log a clear error message indicating the invalid format
3. WHEN an invalid cron expression is detected THEN the system SHALL continue running with the default schedule
4. WHEN a valid cron expression is provided THEN the system SHALL log a confirmation message showing the configured schedule

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the environment variable to be documented, so that I can understand how to configure the detention email schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing system documentation THEN there SHALL be clear documentation of the DETENTION_EMAIL_SCHEDULE environment variable
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN the documentation SHALL include examples of valid cron expressions
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the documentation SHALL explain the default behavior when the variable is not set
4. WHEN setting up the system THEN the documentation SHALL specify the cron format expected (standard 5-field cron format)
